# hello-world
This is my first interaction with GitHub, I've heard great things!
I recently entered the tech world through one of the many aspects of digital marekting, specifically outreach for back-links that help impove SEO. I am now looking for an opportunity as a Sales Development Representative where I seek to arm myself with the type of experience and proof of performance necessary for getting to the AE level, which is where I want to be within the next 12-18 months(todays date 10/22/2018).
